# empirical-likelihood-gps

This repository contains R code supporting the manuscript
"Empirical Likelihood in Causal Inference Settings".

The repository includes:
- Simulation code reproducing the results in the paper
- Core functions for empirical likelihood kernel modifications
  in generalized propensity score (GPS) settings

The real-data application uses restricted data and cannot be
shared publicly. Only simulation code is provided here.

This repository accompanies the tutorial paper and is intended
to facilitate reproducibility of the simulation results.
