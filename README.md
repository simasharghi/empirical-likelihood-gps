For the manuscript titled: "Implementing Empirical Likelihood Within the Causal Inference Framework to Study Causal Effects of Air Pollution on Reproductive Development"



Code Availability and Scope

This repository contains R code supporting the manuscript
“Empirical Likelihood in Causal Inference Settings.”

The goal of this repository is to provide clean, reproducible implementations of the proposed empirical likelihood (EL) methods and to demonstrate their use through simulation-based analyses.

####################

Repository Structure

EL_Core/
Core empirical likelihood utilities and estimator functions, including:

EL solvers and weight construction

EL-weighted kernel density components

EL-based and normal stabilized-weight estimators for continuous GPS settings

These files contain the primary methodological contributions of the paper.

analysis/
Scripts illustrating the simulation and inference workflow:

simulate_data.R: generates simulated datasets used in the study

run_bootstrap.R: applies estimators and performs bootstrap inference

README.md: describes the analysis workflow and expected outputs

data/
Placeholder directory. Generated datasets and simulation outputs are not tracked in this repository.

##############################


Data Availability

Due to data-use restrictions and storage considerations, simulation output files and real-data application datasets are not included in this repository.

All simulation results shown in the manuscript are generated by running the provided scripts locally. Users can reproduce the analyses by:

Running analysis/simulate_data.R to generate simulated datasets

Running analysis/run_bootstrap.R to apply estimators and obtain inference quantities

Using the resulting objects to recreate plots and summaries shown in the paper


####################################

Real-Data Application

The real-data application presented in the manuscript relies on restricted datasets that cannot be shared publicly.

Code for the application analysis may be added in a future update if data-sharing permissions allow. The current repository focuses on the methodological implementation and simulation validation of the proposed approach.


####################################

Notes for Reproducibility

The repository is intended to demonstrate the logic, structure, and implementation of the methods rather than to distribute large result files.

Users are expected to run simulations and bootstrap procedures locally.

Paths to external data sources should be adapted by the user as needed.
