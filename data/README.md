# empirical-likelihood-gps



This repository is intended to accompany the tutorial paper
and facilitate reproducibility of the simulation results.
This repository contains simulation code and functions supporting the manuscript.
The real-data application uses restricted data and cannot be shared publicly.
All results in the paper that rely on non-shareable data are described in the manuscript,
and the simulation scripts in this repository reproduce the simulation figures/tables.

This repository contains R code supporting the manuscript
"Empirical Likelihood in Causal Inference Settings".
