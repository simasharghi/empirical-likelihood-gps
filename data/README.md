# empirical-likelihood-gps

This repository contains R code supporting the manuscript
"Empirical Likelihood in Causal Inference Settings".

The repository includes:
- Simulation code reproducing the results in the paper
- Core functions for empirical likelihood kernel modifications
  in generalized propensity score settings

The real-data application uses restricted data and cannot be
shared publicly. Only simulation code is provided here.

This repository is intended to accompany the tutorial paper
and facilitate reproducibility of the simulation results.
This repository contains simulation code and functions supporting the manuscript.
The real-data application uses restricted data and cannot be shared publicly.
All results in the paper that rely on non-shareable data are described in the manuscript,
and the simulation scripts in this repository reproduce the simulation figures/tables.
